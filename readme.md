# Codeforces Contest code backup

I started doing Codeforces contest in 2015 summer vacation while participating in **2015CPSTC(competitive programming summer training camp)** @NCTU. Thanks to the teacher and student mentors there. :)

This is a repository that I use for backing up my Codeforces code. I am still new to this competitive programming field, so my code may be really bad. Please don't take it too seriously.
