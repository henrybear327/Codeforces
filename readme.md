# Codeforces Contest code backup

I started doing Codeforces contest in 2015 summer vacation while participating in **2015CPSTC(competitive programming summer training camp)** @NCTU. Thanks to the teacher and student mentors there. :)

This is a repository that I use for backing up my Codeforces code. I am still new to this competitive programming field, so my code may be really bad. Please don't take it too seriously.

#List format

The following lists will be written as followed.

* (h1 title) Contest name(type)
    * Division(if present)
        1. Round / contest name
            * solved problem

#Contest(Virtual)

* Div 2
    1. Round 312 (30 minutes left but can't solve more problems, QQ)
        * A, B, C

#Contest(Real time)

* Div 2
    1. Round 312 (The first ever contest that I participated in!)
        * A, B
    2. Round 313
        * A, B, C
    3. Round Pi
        * A, B, C
    4. Round 315
        * A, B, C
    5. Round 316
        * A, B, C
    6. Round 317

# Notes

1. Test for upper/lower bound input that's given by the problem statement.
(Hacks may come from here! Ex: Round 316 Div2 problem B)

2. Does the problem need a linear scan? Or just look at its left and right?
(Round 316 Div2 problem C)

3. Read the problem statements carefully. Use pen and paper to finalise thoughts before actually coding them!

4. Don't rush! Double check the source code and rethink the program flow before submitting the code.

5. If `long long int` is required, decalre all of the variables using `long long int` in case you miss any of them. (2013-2014 Samara SAU ACM ICPC Quarterfinal Qualification Contest problem C, forgot to use `long long int` for `sum_so_far`, stupid)
